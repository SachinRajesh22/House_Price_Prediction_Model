## 📜 Project Description  
This project is a **Machine Learning-based web application** that predicts **house prices** based on various input features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and amenities.  
It uses a trained regression model to estimate property prices, helping users get an instant and data-driven estimate of a house’s worth.

## 💡 The Problem 
Real estate prices fluctuate wildly depending on countless factors — location, area, and even which side of the street the house is on.  
Finding a fair price manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and sometimes just guesswork.  

---

## 🚀 The Solution  
Our **House Price Prediction Model** leverages **Machine Learning** to estimate housing prices quickly and accurately.  
By feeding the model with real estate data and training it on past records, the system learns patterns and relationships to predict future prices.
